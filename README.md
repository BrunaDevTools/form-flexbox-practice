# Sign In Form Practice

This repository contains a practice project for a sign-in form, inspired by a design by Tran Mau Tri Tam. This is one of the first projects I worked on to improve my HTML and CSS skills, particularly focusing on creating responsive forms using Flexbox.

## Description

The project consists of a simple sign-in form that includes:
- Username or Email Address input
- Password input
- A "Sign in with Google" button
- A "Forgot Password?" link

I found inspiration for this design on Pinterest and aimed to recreate the look while learning best practices for form structure and CSS layout.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to add JavaScript functionality to enhance the form's interactivity, such as input validation and error handling.
